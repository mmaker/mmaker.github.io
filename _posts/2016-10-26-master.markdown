As of today I'm completing my course in math, and I want to share some of the
notes I took over these painful years.
Unfortunately, they are all in Italian, and most of them are incomplete, and surely
there's tons of errors in them.
However, I shed enough blood on them already to correct them, and my cosmic sense of purpose
hopes that somebody somewhere will find them useful.
I'ts â’¶-okay to copy them; sources are available on request.

- [Algebraic Geometry I](https://people.develer.com/~maker/scholar/notes/ag.pdf)
    was a course Riemann Surfaces and Algebraic Curves. Turns out most of
    it was in Complex Analysis.
- [Advanced Coding II](https://people.develer.com/~maker/scholar/notes/ac.pdf)
    was a course on elliptic curves.
- [Finite Fields and Symmetric Cryptography](https://people.develer.com/~maker/scholar/notes/ff.pdf)
   was a course on Algebra over Finite Fields and Boolean Functions.
