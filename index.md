# Michele Orrù

I believe that privacy is a human right and that cryptography can help foster an open society.
My research focuses on the intersection of authentication and anonymity.
I work on:

- improving efficiency and security of zero-knowledge proofs,
- lightweight anonymous credential systems,
- confidential transactions.

In the past, I contributed to Python, Debian, and Tor.
I helped design [Globaleaks](http://globaleaks.org/), an open-source whistleblowing platform
now translated in more than 90 languages and used by more than 300 organizations,
and co-authored the cryptography behind Google's [Trust Tokens](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/trust-tokens/).

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at **[UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/)** under
the supervision of [Alessandro Chiesa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/).
I got my PhD in 2020 from **[École Normale Supérieure](https://crypto.di.ens.fr/)**,
advised by [Georg Fuchsbauer](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fuchsbau).
Before, I got my MSc in Mathematics from the [University of Trento](http://www.maths.unitn.it/en).
I attended the **[Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/)** in Fall 2020 (W2'20).
