## About me

<div class="col-1">
I believe that privacy is a human right, and that cryptography can help foster an open society.
My research focuses in the intersection of authentication and anonymity.
I work on:

- lightweight anonymous credential systems
- efficient and more secure zero-knowledge proofs
- confidential transactions.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at **[UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/)** under
the supervision of [Alessandro Chiesa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/).
I got my PhD in 2020 from **[École Normale Supérieure](https://crypto.di.ens.fr/)**,
advised by [Georg Fuchsbauer](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fuchsbau).
Before, I got my MSc in Mathematics from the [University of Trento](http://www.maths.unitn.it/en).

In the past, I have contributed to Python, Debian, and Tor.
I helped design [Globaleaks](http://globaleaks.org/), now translated in more than 90 languages and used by more than 300 organizations,
and authored the cryptography behind Google's [Trust Tokens](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/trust-tokens/).
